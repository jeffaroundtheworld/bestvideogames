	<p>Wii Sports is a 2006 sports simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. 
	The 1.0 (pre-release) version of the game was released in North America along with the Wii on November 19, 2006, and the 1.1 version was released in Japan, Australia, Europe, and North America over the following months. 
	It was included as a pack-in game with the console in all territories except Japan, making it the first sports game included with the launch of a Nintendo system since Mario's Tennis for the Virtual Boy in 1995. 
	The game is available on its own as part of the Nintendo Selects collection of games. Wii Sports is a collection of five sports simulations, which have been designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote. 
	The five sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real-life sports, such as swinging a tennis racket.
	The rules for each game are simplified to make them more accessible to new players. The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports. </p>
